# Week 6 Update â€” DDNS

## Progress (3/3)
- Hardhat workspace boots end-to-end with a DomainRegistry Solidity skeleton, deployment script, and smoke-test exercising domain registration and lookups.
- Resolver and gateway packages compile with TypeScript tooling so the end-to-end environment can run locally once contracts are deployed.
- Repository documentation refreshed with exact setup steps, env samples, and project board link so every teammate can reproduce the stack.

## Evidence (3/3)
- `npm install && npm run compile` builds the DomainRegistry artifacts and TypeScript types.
- `npm test` runs the initial Hardhat test suite that registers a domain and asserts on stored records.
- README walkthrough peer-tested by Indy on macOS (M1) using Node 18 and Hardhat local node.

## Technical Depth (2/2)
- Contract covers ownership lifecycle (register, renew, transfer) plus typed DNS record storage with TTL metadata.
- Test harness seeds signer fixtures, validates emitted events, and checks resolver-style accessors for domain metadata.

## Next Plan (1/1)
- Harden resolver <> gateway integration with signed responses and caching policies.
- Stand up GitHub Actions coverage + linting, then expand contract tests for expiration edge cases.

## Collaboration (1/1)
- Gabby implemented the Solidity skeleton + deploy script, Vien authored the resolver stub, Dheeraj maintained the resolver <> gateway wiring, and Indy executed the peer verification pass on the README runbook.
- Weekly sync held Sunday to assign issues on the GitHub project board (backlog now tracks MVP + stretch stories).
